## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Box Shadow Generator

### What I learned

In this project I mainly put into practice my knowledge about CSS Grid and Javascript with Fetch API. I decided to create a .json document to use as a database, with Javascript consuming it through etch and generating each letter from each user. Doing this seemed like it would save me a lot of time writing HTML.

### Continued development

I want to further improve my CSS skills with Grid, I also want to learn the BEM methodology for more readable and maintainable code.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla MDN Web Docs | CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This resource was very useful, it helped me understand how the radio inputs work.
